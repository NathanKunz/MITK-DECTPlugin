\section org_mitk_views_dualenergyctconversion Overview
This plugin blends two ct image files, with the help of alpha blending into one HU image. For this blending a given alpha value is needed which can either be selected from a 
predinfed list in the alpha blending module or imported through an extern resource file that can be set in the preference page of the alpha blending module. 
After this blending the HU image (or any other HU image) can be convertet to a relative energy density iamge. 

\section org_mitk_views_dualenergyctconversion Usage
<ul>
	<li>Load two images into MITK. One with a lower voltage level and one with a higher voltage level from a dual energy ct.
	<ul>
		<li>Preferably a 3D image, but everything from 2D to 4D images and int,double and float should work.
	</ul>
	<li>Open the DECT plugin and select the images.

	<li>Then select the conversion mode with the fitting alpha value or select custom alpha value and type in a custom one or select an extern resource in the preference page.
	<ul>
		<li>Per default some standard modes are displayed which are defined in alpha blending module alphaValues.xml files.
	</ul>
	<li>Press the Alpha Blend Button.
	<ul>
		<li>The blended image should pop up in the image list and be selected standard as the image for the relative electron density conversion
	</ul>
	<li>Pres rED Conversion to convert the selected image from HU values to rED values.
</ul>

\section org_mitk_views_dualenergyctconversion Result

Result should be two images, their names should be the low energy image name + (HU) or (rED)
